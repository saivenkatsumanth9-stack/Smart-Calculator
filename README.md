#🔬 ClassWiz Studio — Scientific Calculator
> A feature-rich, visually stunning web-based scientific calculator inspired by the **Casio fx-991CW ClassWiz**, built with a **Monochrome / Stealth** glassmorphic UI and zero dependencies to install.
---
## 🚀 Quick Start
### Option 1 — Direct File (simplest)
Just double-click `index.html` in File Explorer. It opens directly in your browser.
> ⚠️ Voice input and camera scan require a server (Option 2).
### Option 2 — Local Server (recommended)
```bash
# Python (comes pre-installed on most systems)
python -m http.server 8080
# Then open in your browser:
http://localhost:8080
```

## 📁 Project Structure
```
s:/clasi/
├── index.html      ← Entire app (HTML + CSS + JS, self-contained ~90 KB)
└── README.md       ← This file
```
Everything — markup, styles, and logic — lives inside a single `index.html`.  
All external libraries are loaded from CDN (no npm, no build step).

- Plot any function of `x` — e.g. `sin(x)*x`, `x^2 - 3`, `1/x`
- **Zoom in / out / reset** controls
- Graph re-renders on theme toggle (dark / light)
- **Equation Solver** panel:
  - **Quadratic** — solves `ax² + bx + c = 0` (real & complex roots)
  - **Linear System** — solves 2×2 simultaneous equations

### 📷 Scan Mode (Image-to-Solve)
1. Tap the **Scan** tab
2. Upload a photo or drag & drop an image of a printed/handwritten expression
3. **Tesseract.js OCR** reads the expression automatically
4. Edit the recognized text if needed, then tap **Solve**
> Best results with clear, printed text. Complex handwriting may need a manual edit.
### 🎙️ Voice Input
- Tap the **microphone icon** (top right) and speak your calculation
- Supports natural language: *"twenty five times square root of nine"*
- Converts spoken words to math syntax automatically
- Visual pulse animation while listening
- Requires Chrome or Edge browser
> Voice input requires the page to be served over HTTP (use the local server).
### 📚 Formula Library (Left Sidebar)
A searchable reference of **80+ formulas** across 8 categories:
- Algebra
- Geometry & Mensuration
- Trigonometry
- Calculus
- Statistics & Probability
- Coordinate Geometry
- Physics
- Finance & Misc
Each formula has:
- **Insert (＋)** — loads a sample expression into the calculator
- **Copy** — copies the formula text to clipboard

## 🛠️ Development Notes
- **No build step** — edit `index.html` directly and refresh
- **No frameworks** — plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **No backend** — fully client-side; all computation runs in the browser
- **Persistent memory** — `M+/M−/MR/MC` values persist for the session
- **Error handling** — friendly messages for divide-by-zero, domain errors, syntax errors with shake animation
